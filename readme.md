There are quite a lot of flatbed scripts available already, mostly paid versions; which are often overpriced, lacking in features, badly optimized and buggy. This script looks to tackle these problems, with a focus on synchronization/optimization, support for target interactions and immersive animations/sound-effects.

## Features
- Actions are fully synchronized between players and optimized for performance. Use the same flatbed with multiple people without any issues.
- Automatically synchronizes existing flatbed statuses for newly joined players.
- Works out of the box when using ox-target or qb-target, no dependencies on other scripts.
- Many configurable options, like flatbed model, animations, locales and optional job checks.
- Immersive animations and sound effects when interacting with the flatbed.
**Resmon:** Always 0.0 ms unless interacting with the flatbed.
